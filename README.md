# Introduction
Bind Shell written in C using Win32 API, the approach used is synchronous for both: Sockets and Process Pipes.<br/>
For more Reverse Shell and/or Bind Shell implementations written in other programming languages and frameworks
check out my Github page.

If you prefer a different approach to manage Process Pipes then you may look at my ProcessWin32Snippets Repo(At this moment in time
it is not pushed to Github, but it may be at the time of you reading this).

## WARNING
This is not the same code as other C Win32 Bind shell I have on Github, that other, directly assigns the process
pipes to the socket, this one in the other hand, it does not.
